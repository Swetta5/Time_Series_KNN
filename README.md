Understanding of KNN: KNN stands for k-nearest neighbors algorithm, a non-parametric, supervised learning method used for both classification and regression tasks, 
by classifying data points based on their proximity to the nearest neighbors in the training data. 
CV:Cross-validation is a statistical technique used to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model. It involves splitting a dataset into multiple subsets, training the model on a subset of the data, and testing its performance on the remaining subsets. 
This process is repeated several times, with each subset used as the test set exactly once.
Cross-validation helps to avoid overfitting by providing a more accurate estimate of a model's performance on unseen data. It is commonly used in regression, classification, and clustering tasks, and is a crucial step in model selection and hyperparameter tuning.
